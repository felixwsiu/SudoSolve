## General info
Conventional sudoku solvers with backtracking and brute force run times didn't sound very exciting, thats why SudoSolve was created!
<br>
<br>SudoSolve imitates beginner and advanced techniques that real humans use to solve sudokus but at a computer processing speed. 
<br>Techniques can be found at @https://www.learn-sudoku.com/advanced-techniques.html

<br>and solve the given number of puzzles the user wants.
